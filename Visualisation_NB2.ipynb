    "# Data Visualisation Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### A basic Python toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "For a data scientist working in Python/Pandas, there are two principal visualisation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of these tools is the built-in Pandas plotting capabilities. These are convenient built-in methods, which make it easy to create quick plots from Pandas dataframes, without much code. We have already previewed these in the first section, and we will see them more below.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will emphasise examples of creating plots using the Matplotlib plotting library. Matplotlib is the most widely-used and general-purpose Python visualisation library, and perhaps the most powerful. As such, it is important to get to grips with, and a great way to learn the fundamentals of Python visualisation (later, we'll also discuss other visualisation libraries and tools, in Python and beyond).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we use these tools to make data visualisations? And how do we make *good* data visualisations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's workbooks will look at some basic answers to these questions, and on Tuesday we will delve into some more advanced examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout, you should execute the code cells, and try to solve any errors that you run into."

    "### Where do I start with data visualisation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The general answer here is to be guided by your data: choosing a type of visualisation that suits your data, and your purpose in visualising it, is crucial. This course will give you examples of important types of visualisation, and discuss what they are best suited for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the major considerations here include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is your data qualitative, or quantitative? \n",
    "* If quantitative, is your data continuous or discrete?\n",
    "* What inherent relationships exist in the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, guides to data visualisation focus principally on quantitiative data. This is not to say you can't make great figures using qualitative data! However, such visualisations are often more appropriately classified as \"information visualisations\" or \"information graphics\". Although the distinction is a blurry one, these graphics (for example, flow charts, mind maps, dendrograms, and most types of \"diagrams\") are usually considered separately to from data visualisation/scientific visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, this discussion will focus on examples using quantitative data. We will use data from the City of Melbourne's Open Data Portal to demonstrate various key types of visualisation, and when they should be used.\n"

    "### Scatter Plots - Part I\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot is one of the simplest, but most powerful, types of visualisation. A scatter plot represents the relationship between two variables, x and y, by marking points on a (usually) Cartesian plane. \n",
    "\n",
    "A point is marked at the coordinate ($x_{i}, y_{i}$), for each row $i$ in your data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot is suitable for any two variables x and y - but particularly suitable for discrete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By inspecting the distribution of the points, we can infer what relationship (if any) exists between x and y. This is the approach we used in the last notebook, to identify different relationships between the four datasets of Anscombe's Quartet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, let's take some example data from the City of Melbourne CLUE survey, which profiles various Melbourne suburbs on key demographic and social indicators.\n"
